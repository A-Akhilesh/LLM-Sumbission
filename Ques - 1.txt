Question: Can algorithms like SMOTE/ROSE which synthesize new examples from the training data be called Generative AI?

Answer: Algorithms like SMOTE and ROSE aren't considered Generative AI. 
SMOTE creates new data points by interpolating between existing minority class examples,
while ROSE adds random noise to existing data to generate variations.
These techniques are straightforward methods for addressing class imbalance in datasets.
In contrast, Generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, understand the underlying data distribution 
and can generate entirely new, high-quality data instances. 
They employ advanced techniques like adversarial training and probabilistic sampling, 
enabling them to produce complex data in various domains like images, text, and audio.
